Instant messaging online with this extremely simple messaging service.

Note that there is absolutely no web security, so JS/HTML injection is very possible. On the bright side, you can use this to embed audio, Youtube videos, and much more.

### How To Install/Run
This is a very simple node project, and can be run as you'd expect.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pimpale/messaging
$ cd ./messaging
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
By default, the app will open on port 8080, but you can change this by editing app.js.


### How To Use
Change your display name by editing the text in the upper left hand box.  Write your message in the text area in the upper right hand box, and once ready, click the submit button. More recent messages should appear at the top, and older messages at the bottom.
